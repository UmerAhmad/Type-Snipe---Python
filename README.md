WHAT IS TYPE SNIPE - Type to defeat enemies. Every enemy is worth 50 points, and every 500 points until 1000 is a boss (Multiple words have to be typed). After the boss, the next group of enemies is harder, (faster and harder words). After the final boss, enemies have the highest amount of letters per word and get faster with each
kill.

HOW TO PLAY - Simply use the python file and run it, everything is done inside (loading files and such).
