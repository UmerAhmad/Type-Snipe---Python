WHAT IS TYPE SNIPE - Type Snipe is a one player game that provides a competitive feeling through the use of high scores. The player is a ship that is tasked with defending a station by preventing a numerous amount of enemy ships
to pass him on the screen. They can do this by typing out the words written onto the enemy ships, which will destroy them. Every enemy is worth 50 points, and every 500 points untill 1000 provides the player with a monumental task,
to defeat the boss (Multiple words have to be typed). After the boss, the next group of enemies is harder, (faster and harder words). After the final boss, enemies have the highest amount of letters per word and get faster with each
kill.

HOW TO PLAY - Simply use the python file and run it, everything is done inside (loading files and such).
